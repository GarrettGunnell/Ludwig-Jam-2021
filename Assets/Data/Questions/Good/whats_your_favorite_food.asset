      talkReponse: So, basically, it's amazing because you have dozens of shapes,
        and hundreds of sauces and ways to cook them, combined with hundreds of side
        dishes, sometimes the pasta is the side dish! It's easy to make, so it has
        a low floor but a high ceiling in terms of skill. It's truly the food for
        both beginners and the most excellent of chefs.
